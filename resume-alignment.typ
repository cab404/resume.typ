Being a part of several communities grown around works of Eliezer Yudkovsky (most notably Kocherga), I've taken interest in the alignment problem.

I am worried about current state of affairs in the interpretability field, and ongoing race between bigger companies to blindly increase capabilities only makes it feel more dire.

It would be a great pleasure to participate first-hand in a team of likeminded people pushing towards humanity actually having a future.
